    <h3>Job Experience</h3>
    <ul class="textbox">
      <li>Chef De Cuisine, Le Pigeon, Portland, OR</li>
        <ul>
          <li>July 2011 - October 2021</li>
          <li>At Le Pigeon I worked my way up from:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Stagiere (i.e. the lowest, unpaid position responsible for picking parsley and other menial tasks). To:</li>
              <li>Chef de Cuisine (i.e. second in command to the executive chef, responsible for overseeing all food preparations, creating unique dishes, and picking parsley.</li>
              <li>(There were a few positions in between; and yes, they involved picking parsley.)</li>
            </ol>
          <li>I loved my time at Le Pigeon!  After 10 years, one would hope so.  The my coworkers are like a family to me.  I will miss them dearly.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Volunteer GED Tutor and Cook, Outside In, Portland</li>
        <ul>
          <li>June 2015 - November 2016</li>
          <li>I had two different roles during my time volunteering at Outside In.
            <ul>
              <li>I worked in the kitchen utilizing donated food to create and serve healthy meals to hungry people.</li>
              <li>I also taught in their GED tutoring program, empowering at-risk students on their journey to success.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Outside In is a wonderful program which houses, feeds, provides medical assistance, etc. to youths experiencing houselessness.  Volunteering with them was a wonderful experience and I hope to return someday!</li>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p class="textbox">My hobbies mostly revolve around my dog, Gina.  She is a 1-year-old herding dog mix mutt.  She is a joy to take for walks in the morning, and to play with in the evening.  She's a big goofball and never fails to make me laugh.</p>
    <div class="imageboxr">
      <img src="img/hushpuppies.jpeg" width="300" height="375" alt="photo of a plate of food">
      <p class="caption">This is a photo I took of a dish I created for Le Pigeon!  It's a vegeterian entrée of hushpuppies, roast squash, and pickled chanterelles.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="textbox">My non-Gina related hobbies include climbing at the climbing gym, cooking, photography and digital art, and music/going to concerts.  A few of these I haven't done for a while due to Covid restrictions, but in that time I've done a ton of cooking.</p>
    <h3>Why I decided to enroll in Epicodus</h3>
    <div class="textbox">
      <p>I enrolled in Epicodus to make a career change.  My former career, cooking, was fulfulling in many ways; but it was physically exhausting and time intensive.  I felt like I needed a better life/work balance.</p>
      <p>I also enrolled because, of the coding I’ve done in the past, I've truly enjoyed it!  I can get into a flow state with coding and lose track of time.  It feels really good.  I enrolled in the camp as an expedient way to learn and get a job.  I had been trying to learn on my own before but I realized with my 60-hour work weeks I wouldn't get through as quickly as I wanted.</p>
