  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
  <img src="img/gina.jpg" width="300" height="375" alt="photo of my dog Gina, panting and dirty from running at the beach">
  <p>My hobbies mostly revolve around my dog, Gina.  She is a 1-year-old herding dog mix mutt.  She is a joy to take for walks in the morning, and to play with in the evening.  She's a big goofball and never fails to make me laugh.</p>
  <img src="img/hushpuppies.jpg" width="300" height="375" alt="photo of a plate of food">
  <p>This is a photo I took of a dish I created for Le Pigeon!  It's a vegeterian entrée of hushpuppies, roast squash, and pickled chanterelles.</p>
  <p>My non-Gina related hobbies include climbing at the climbing gym, cooking, photography and digital art, and music/going to concerts.  A few of these I haven't done for a while due to Covid restrictions, but in that time I've done a ton of cooking.</p>
  <h3>Why I decided to enroll in Epicodus</h3>
  <p>I enrolled in Epicodus to make a career change.  My former career, cooking, was fulfulling in many ways; but it was physically exhausting and time intensive.  I felt like I needed a better life/work balance.</p>
  <p>I also enrolled because, of the coding I’ve done in the past, I've truly enjoyed it!  I can get into a flow state with coding and lose track of time.  It feels really good.  I enrolled in the camp as an expedient way to learn and get a job.  I had been trying to learn on my own before but I realized with my 60-hour work weeks I wouldn't get through as quickly as I wanted.</p>
